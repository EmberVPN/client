## Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18+)

You're also going to need an IDE and [Ember VPN account](https://embervpn.org/authorize/create). For an IDE, we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

```
3. Run the application (dev mode).

```

## Building
